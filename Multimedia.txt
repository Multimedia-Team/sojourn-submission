		TEAM MULTIMEDIA
===============================================


For this project the multimedia team was responsible for all things audio and visual. Everything you hear or see in the game was created by our team. 

Visually, all artwork was created by Rhea Lauzon. The artwork present in the game ranges from the tiles of the game, each animation for the characters and enemies, menu buttons, the logo, and much much more.  

Audio presented in the game was created by Lewis Scott. In order for this to be completed, he also created a sound manager to load the audio files into the game. Lewis created sounds for the enemies as well as foot steps, announcer voices, and more. He also created some interactable GUI elements, such as buttons, text fields, etc... He created the sprite-sheet animation implementation for the engine.

In order for anything to appear on the screen, Melvin Loho took on creating the renderer from scratch. This renderer allows images to be placed on the screen in their specified location. This was a large part of the game's backbone. Melvin also worked on the various managers.

The multimedia also created shaders and the particle system.
