For this project the multimedia team was responsible for all things audio and visual. Everything you hear or see in the game was created by our team. 

Visually, all artwork was created by Rhea Lauzon. The artwork present in the game ranges from the tiles of the game, each animation for the characters and enemies, menu buttons, the logo, and much much more.  

Audio presented in the game was created by Lewis Scott. In order for this to be completed, he also created a sound manager to load the audio files into the game. Lewis created sounds for the enemies as well as foot steps, announcer voices, and more. He also created some interactable GUI elements, such as buttons, text fields, etc... He created the sprite-sheet animation implementation for the engine.

Melvin Loho has created a graphical hierarchy system and a custom renderer which both serve a large part of the game's backbone. The hierarchy system allows all game entities to be positioned relatively which makes it easy to add entities to the map and to add GUI elements to the scene without having to manually calculate all of their individual positions. The custom renderer features rendering for all of the game objects, sprite batching which increases performance by reducing system draw calls, fast tiled map rendering and batched entity rendering. He has also designed the AppWindow and Scene system which is responsible for the game loop that processes events, handles logical updates and drawing requests all in their own controlled time intervals. He has also done the initial design work of the Resource Managers and GUI elements.

The multimedia team also created shaders and the particle system.
